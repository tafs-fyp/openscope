# Philadelphia International Airport

### About This Facility
The Philadelphia International Airport (PHL) is a large hub airport in Philadelphia, PA. PHL is currently a hub airport for American Airlines and UPS. PHL has four runways: two long parallel runways used by air carriers (9L/27R & 9R/27L), a third, shorter parallel (8/26) which is used by business and GA aircraft. Finally, there is a crosswind runway (17/35) that is used by smaller air carrier aircraft and GA aircraft.

### Airspace
The airspace around PHL (Class B) is highly complex, with PHL TRACON owning multiple areas from the surface up to 13,000 ft. 

### Instrument Procedures
PHL is served by four RNAV arrivals. The arrivals are not automated and have a number of "expect" altitudes. All "expect" altitudes that would have been assigned by the center prior to entering PHL's airspace have been included in the sim. PHL only has one departure procedure, the PHL2. It is a radar-vectored departure to several departure fixes. An aircraft's initial heading on departure is based on the departure fix. These headings have been included in the sim and do not have to be specifically assigned by the player. However, for your information, the table of headings is below.
